            <div class="about-grid">
                <p>From a vision to reality – transforming careers and connecting dreams with opportunities. Founded by
                    experienced professionals who understand both the tech landscape and the American job market, Next
                    Horizon Talent was born from a simple vision: to help talented IT professionals achieve their dreams
                    of working in the United States.</p>
                <p>Our founders, having successfully navigated their own journey from India to establishing careers in
                    the US, recognized the challenges faced by aspiring professionals. This personal experience drives
                    our commitment to providing authentic, transparent, and effective career placement services.</p>
                <p>With over a decade of combined experience in recruitment, career counseling, and cross-cultural
                    business practices, our team has developed a deep understanding of what it takes to succeed in the
                    competitive American job market while maintaining the values and work ethic that make professionals
                    exceptional.</p>

                <h2>Why Next Horizon Talent....?</h2>
                <p> At Next Horizon Talent, we believe that every career journey begins with a dream — a dream to
                    achieve something greater, to cross boundaries, and to build a future filled with opportunities. Our
                    mission is to turn that dream into reality by bridging the gap between ambitious talent and the
                    thriving American job market. More than just a placement firm, we are a trusted partner who stands
                    with you at every stage of your professional journey.</p>

                <p>Our story is one of passion, dedication, and a commitment to ethical practices. We understand that
                    the journey to finding the right job in the United States can be daunting. From navigating complex
                    visa processes to adapting to a new work culture, the challenges are many. That’s why we focus on
                    personalized guidance, ensuring that every candidate receives the support they need to succeed.</p>

                <p>Next Horizon Talent was founded with a clear purpose: to empower IT and non-IT professionals from
                    around the world to achieve their career aspirations in the United States.
                </p>

                <p> story began with a vision born from personal experience. Our founders, themselves IT professionals
                    who successfully transitioned from India to established careers in the United States, recognized the
                    unique challenges faced by talented individuals aspiring to work in the US. They knew the obstacles
                    — navigating a new job market, adapting to cultural differences, and understanding the complex
                    recruitment landscape. With this understanding, they created Next Horizon Talent to guide others
                    through the same journey with transparency, authenticity, and care.</p>

                <p>Over the years, we have transformed that vision into reality. With over a decade of combined
                    experience in recruitment, career counseling, and cross-cultural business practices, our team has
                    helped hundreds of professionals successfully land roles in the United States. Today, we proudly
                    celebrate 500 successful placements, a 99% success rate, 50+ partner companies, and an average
                    placement time of just 30 days. These numbers are not just statistics — they reflect lives
                    transformed, careers built, and dreams achieved.</p>

                <p>Our mission is simple yet powerful: to help tech and non-tech talent find the right opportunities in
                    the United States through ethical practices, personalized guidance, and unwavering support. We go
                    beyond job placements. We focus on building long-term relationships that nurture growth, foster
                    confidence, and ensure sustainable career success. We stand as a cultural bridge, helping
                    professionals adapt to American work culture while embracing the values and strengths they carry
                    from their own backgrounds.</p>

                    for professionals around the globe. We envision a future where talent knows no borders and where
